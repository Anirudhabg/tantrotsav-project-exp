                    <h2>Smart Parking</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Smart Parking System is an IoT-based solution designed to
                        automate and streamline the vehicle parking process using Arduino Uno, IR sensors, a servo
                        motor, and an LCD display. This system detects the entry and exit of vehicles using two infrared
                        sensors placed at the entrance and exit of the parking area. When a vehicle is detected at the
                        entrance, the system checks the availability of parking slots. If space is available, the servo
                        motor automatically opens the gate, and the available slot count is updated and displayed on the
                        LCD screen. Similarly, when a vehicle exits, the system detects it and updates the slot count
                        accordingly.
                        The aim of this project is to reduce manual intervention, prevent parking space misuse, and
                        provide real-time updates on slot availability. By automating the parking process, the system
                        enhances efficiency, reduces congestion, and improves user experience in crowded parking areas.
                        This prototype can be implemented in malls, offices, and public parking areas, and further
                        expanded with cloud connectivity and mobile app integration for remote monitoring. The entire
                        system is developed using the Arduino platform and is easy to set up, cost-effective, and
                        scalable for larger implementations.</p>

                    <h2>Rain Detection Alarm</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Internet of Things has revolutionized weather monitoring and
                        automation, enabling
                        smart solutions for everyday challenges. One such innovation is the rain detection alarm
                        with automatic shelter closing, designed to provide protection against unexpected rainfall.
                        This system is especially useful in open spaces such as balconies, parking lots, stadiums,
                        and agricultural fields, where sudden rain can cause inconvenience or damage.
                        This IoT-based system functions using a rain sensor, microcontroller such as Arduino,
                        motorized shelter mechanism, and an alert system. When rain is detected, the sensor trans
                        mits a signal to the microcontroller, which then activates the motorized mechanism to close
                        the shelter. At the same time, an alarm or notification is triggered to inform the user of
                        the weather condition. This automation ensures quick and efficient protection without re
                        quiring manual intervention. The system offers multiple benefits, including automation,
                        real-time monitoring, and remote access via mobile applications or cloud-based platforms.
                        Users can monitor and control the system from anywhere, making it highly effective for
                        smart homes, industries, and agricultural applications. By preventing rain-related damage,
                        this technology also helps protect valuable assets and equipment.
                        Future advancements in IoT can further enhance this system by integrating weather
                        prediction data and AI-based decision-making. This would improve efficiency by enabling
                        the system to take preventive actions based on upcoming weather forecasts. As technology
                        continues to evolve, such smart solutions will play a crucial role in creating a safer, more
                        convenient, and automated lifestyle.</p>

                    <h2>Real Time Object Detection with Description</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ensuring workplace safety in hazardous environments like
                        construction sites and factories
                        is a significant challenge for employers and safety managers. Despite strict regulations,
                        incidents of workers neglecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) continue to pose
                        serious risks, leading to accidents and legal consequences. Traditional monitoring methods
                        are often manual, inefficient, and prone to human error, making it difficult to ensure
                        consistent compliance with safety standards.
                        To address this critical issue, we propose a Real-Time Safety Detection System Using
                        IoT. Utilizing components like Arduino Uno and ESP32 Camera, the system continuously
                        captures real-time images from the workplace. Advanced image processing algorithms
                        analyze the images to detect whether workers are wearing essential PPE, such as helmets,
                        gloves, and vests. If any safety violation is identified, the system immediately triggers an
                        alert message, notifying supervisors and relevant personnel.
                        This automated approach ensures proactive safety management by providing instant
                        notifications, enabling swift corrective actions. The system promotes a safer work
                        environment, minimizes the risk of accidents, and enhances compliance with safety
                        regulations. By leveraging IoT technology, our solution offers a cost-effective and reliable
                        means of improving workplace safety, fostering accountability, and protecting workers’
                        well-being.</p>

                    <h2>SafeWalk: Ensuring Women Saftey in Public Spaces</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The safety of women in public spaces remains a critical global
                        issue, significantly affecting
                        their freedom, participation, and overall well-being. Alarming statistics indicate that one in
                        three women worldwide may experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime,
                        underscoring the urgent need for effective intervention. Persistent threats such as verbal and
                        physical harassment, assault, and the constant fear of violence restrict women's mobility and
                        public engagement, depriving them of their sense of security and independence. This initiative
                        introduces a comprehensive, technology-driven approach to enhance women's safety in public areas
                        by integrating advanced solutions, community involvement, and strategic partnerships. The
                        primary objective is to develop an all-in-one system that ensures both psychological and
                        physical security for women navigating public spaces. Key features include a user-friendly
                        mobile app built using React Native for seamless communication, Next.js powers the
                        implementation of real-time safety insights through community-based reporting, incident
                        reporting and SOS emergency alert button for instant assistance. Additionally, the system
                        integrates Firebase for secure user and admin authentication, ensuring a reliable and protected
                        access system. Also, the system includes identification of safety zones for the users. By
                        implementing these essential features, the project empowers women with a renewed sense of
                        confidence and security, enabling them to reclaim public spaces without fear. Beyond being a
                        technological solution, this initiative represents a broader societal commitment to safeguarding
                        women's rights and dignity. Through strategic planning, innovation, and collaboration, the
                        project aims to establish a new benchmark for public safety and diversity.</p>

                    <h2>KSRTC Bus Notification System</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The KSRTC Rural Bus Notification System is a web-based application
                        that sends real-time
                        updates and messages to passengers on bus availability, routes, and delays. The system is
                        made up of two main modules: Admin and User. The Admin module enables authorized
                        workers to control bus routes using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and
                        to send notifications of delays or route cancellations. The User module allows passengers
                        to view bus schedules, check route availability, find nearby stations, and receive email
                        notifications about cancellations and delays. There is also map integration that helps users
                        locate all nearby bus stations within a 5 km range. This system increases the efficiency
                        of public transportation by keeping passengers informed, minimizing uncertainty, and
                        improving their overall trip experience. It is intended to be user-friendly, with seamless
                        access to information for both administrators and passengers. This system acts as a
                        connection between passengers and the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation,
                        promoting a more transparent and dependable public transportation system</p>
