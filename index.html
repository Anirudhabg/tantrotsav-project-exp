                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In today’s digital world, image transformation plays a crucial role
                        in various applications,
                        including entertainment, social media, and AI-driven enhancements. However, converting
                        real images into cartoon-style visuals requires advanced techniques that balance artistic
                        creativity with computational efficiency. Traditional methods often struggle to maintain
                        key image details while simplifying colors and textures. This project aims to develop
                        an automated cartoonization system that effectively transforms images while preserving
                        essential features, making it suitable for creative and analytical purposes.</p>

                    <h2>Color Detection using OpenCV</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In today’s digital age, the ability to analyze and visualize data
                        efficiently has become a
                        critical skill. One of the most intriguing areas of data analysis is color detection and visual
                        ization, which has wide-ranging applications from digital art to web design and marketing.
                        Addressing this need, our Color Detection application, developed using the powerful Flask
                        web framework, offers a seamless solution for detecting and analyzing colors from user
                        uploaded images.
                        The application allows users to upload images, which are then processed to identify
                        the most prominent colors within the image. By using Python’s versatile libraries like
                        Pillow for image processing and Chart.js for data visualization, this project provides an
                        interactive experience that not only detects color distribution but also displays it through
                        visually appealing charts and graphs.
                        The application leverages powerful Python libraries such as PIL and NumPy to accurately analyze
                        the pixel data of the image and identify the most dominant colors. This ensures reliable and
                        meaningful results, which are then displayed in real-time to the user.
                        The proposed Color Detection project aims to offer a comprehensive and intuitive solu
                        tion for identifying and visualizing the most common colors in images. Focusing on the
                        analysis of color distribution, the system allows users to easily upload images, detect the
                        most prominent colors, and visualize this data through dynamic charts. By incorporating
                        both command-line and graphical user interfaces, the project accommodates a wide range
                        of user preferences and technical skills.
                        In addition to basic color detection, the project includes data visualization, enabling
                        users to gain insights into the distribution of colors through interactive bar and pie charts.
                        This visualization allows users to quickly grasp the prevalence of specific colors within
                        an image, making it an ideal tool for designers, artists, and anyone working with visual
                        content.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Obstacle Avoiding Vehicle</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> An Obstacle Avoiding Vehicle is an autonomous robot designed to
                        navigate
                        through an environment while detecting and avoiding obstacles. This
                        system uses an Arduino UNO as the central controller, which processes
                        inputs from an Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the distance between the
                        vehicle and nearby objects. When an obstacle is detected within a specified
                        range, the vehicle automatically takes action, such as stopping, moving
                        backward, or turning left or right to avoid collisions. The Servo motor is
                        used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, enabling the vehicle to scan the
                        surroundings in different directions. The L298N H-Bridge motor driver
                        controls the movement of the vehicle's motors, which drive the wheels.
                        This setup allows the vehicle to move forward, backward, or turn based on
                        the information gathered by the sensor. The overall design ensures that the
                        vehicle can autonomously navigate through its environment by
                        continuously adjusting its path to avoid obstacles.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Parking</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Smart Parking System is an IoT-based solution designed to
                        automate and streamline the vehicle parking process using Arduino Uno, IR sensors, a servo
                        motor, and an LCD display. This system detects the entry and exit of vehicles using two infrared
                        sensors placed at the entrance and exit of the parking area. When a vehicle is detected at the
                        entrance, the system checks the availability of parking slots. If space is available, the servo
                        motor automatically opens the gate, and the available slot count is updated and displayed on the
                        LCD screen. Similarly, when a vehicle exits, the system detects it and updates the slot count
                        accordingly.
                        The aim of this project is to reduce manual intervention, prevent parking space misuse, and
                        provide real-time updates on slot availability. By automating the parking process, the system
                        enhances efficiency, reduces congestion, and improves user experience in crowded parking areas.
                        This prototype can be implemented in malls, offices, and public parking areas, and further
                        expanded with cloud connectivity and mobile app integration for remote monitoring. The entire
                        system is developed using the Arduino platform and is easy to set up, cost-effective, and
                        scalable for larger implementations.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Fish Feeder</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project presents the design and implementation of a smart fish
                        feeder using IoT and embedded system technology. Aimed at automating the feeding process in home
                        aquariums, the system addresses the common problem of irregular fish feeding due to the busy
                        lifestyles of pet owners. The core of the project revolves around an Arduino Uno
                        microcontroller, which controls a servo motor to dispense fish food at preset intervals. The

                        flexibility based on the needs of different fish species. To enhance usability, an LED indicator
                        provides visual confirmation during each feeding cycle, while a manual ON/OFF switch ensures
                        safe operation and prevents overfeeding or malfunction. The entire setup is powered by an
                        external power supply and battery, ensuring portability and uninterrupted operation even during
                        power outages. The system has been tested for reliability, power efficiency, and feeding
                        accuracy, proving to be an effective and user-friendly solution. By combining automation with
                        real-time feedback and manual control, this project contributes to smart pet care and promotes
                        sustainable fish-keeping practices. In the future it can be modified so that even pets like cats
                        and dogs are fed.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Door System</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Smart Door Lock System using a Password Pattern is a modern,
                        IoT-based security solution designed to enhance safety and convenience by replacing traditional
                        keys with a programmable access system. At the heart of this project is the Arduino UNO, which
                        acts as the main controller. It interfaces with a 4×4 matrix keypad for password input, an LCD
                        display with an I2C module for real-time feedback, and a servo motor that controls the physical
                        locking and unlocking of the door. When a user inputs a password via the keypad, the Arduino
                        compares it with a predefined password. If the password is correct, the system displays “Access
                        Granted” on the LCD and activates the servo motor to unlock the door. If incorrect, access is
                        denied and an appropriate message is shown. All components are connected using jumper wires,
                        ensuring a clean and efficient hardware setup. This project presents a low-cost and scalable
                        alternative to conventional door locking systems. It is ideal for homes, offices, and restricted
                        areas. Future enhancements may include features like fingerprint scanning, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
                        control, and integration with smart home ecosystems, making the system more versatile and
                        secure. This project effectively showcases how IoT can be applied in everyday life to improve
                        security systems.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Dustbin</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Maintaining cleanliness and hygiene has become a crucial concern,
                        especially in indoor
                        environments like homes, offices, schools, and hospitals. One of the most common sources of
                        contamination is the traditional dustbin, which requires manual handling for disposing of
                        waste. To address this problem, we have developed an IoT-based smart dustbin that provides a
                        touch-free waste disposal solution using basic electronic components. This project uses an
                        Arduino Uno microcontroller as the core of the system, along with an ultrasonic sensor, servo
                        motor, and battery power supply to operate efficiently in an indoor setting.
                        The working principle of the smart dustbin is simple yet effective. The ultrasonic sensor
                        continuously monitors for any object (like a user's hand or a waste item) within a certain
                        range.
                        Once it detects an object, it sends a signal to the Arduino, which in turn activates the servo
                        motor to open the lid of the dustbin. After a short delay, which gives the user enough time to
                        throw in the waste, the lid closes automatically. This smart mechanism ensures that the user
                        does not need to touch the dustbin at any point, thereby reducing the chances of spreading
                        germs or viruses through physical contact.
                        The main objective of this project is to encourage safe and hygienic waste disposal,
                        particularly
                        in closed and frequently used spaces. While the model is simple and cost-effective, it showcases
                        the potential of using IoT and automation to improve everyday tasks. This smart dustbin not
                        only helps in reducing the risk of contamination but also promotes cleanliness and ease of use
                        for all age groups. Its design is compact, power-efficient, and easy to install in various
                        indoor
                        settings. In conclusion, this project demonstrates how basic IoT integration can lead to
                        practical
                        and health-focused innovations for a cleaner living environment.</p>

                    <h2>Real Time Object Detection with Description</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ensuring workplace safety in hazardous environments like
                        construction sites and factories
                        is a significant challenge for employers and safety managers. Despite strict regulations,
                        incidents of workers neglecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) continue to pose
                        serious risks, leading to accidents and legal consequences. Traditional monitoring methods
                        are often manual, inefficient, and prone to human error, making it difficult to ensure
                        consistent compliance with safety standards.
                        To address this critical issue, we propose a Real-Time Safety Detection System Using
                        IoT. Utilizing components like Arduino Uno and ESP32 Camera, the system continuously
                        captures real-time images from the workplace. Advanced image processing algorithms
                        analyze the images to detect whether workers are wearing essential PPE, such as helmets,
                        gloves, and vests. If any safety violation is identified, the system immediately triggers an
                        alert message, notifying supervisors and relevant personnel.
                        This automated approach ensures proactive safety management by providing instant
                        notifications, enabling swift corrective actions. The system promotes a safer work
                        environment, minimizes the risk of accidents, and enhances compliance with safety
                        regulations. By leveraging IoT technology, our solution offers a cost-effective and reliable
                        means of improving workplace safety, fostering accountability, and protecting workers’
                        well-being.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Weather Forecasting</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Weather forecasting is a critical aspect of modern life, impacting
                        sectors such as agriculture,
                        transportation, disaster management, and urban planning. Accurate weather predictions
                        help in preparing for extreme conditions, optimizing resource utilization, and enhancing
                        safety measures. Traditional weather monitoring systems rely on large-scale infrastructure,
                        satellite data, and meteorological models, which may not always provide localized and realtime
                        weather insights. To address these limitations, the integration of the Internet of Things
                        (IoT) has emerged as a transformative solution for weather forecasting.
                        This project presents an IoT-based weather monitoring system that utilizes rain and temperature
                        sensors to measure environmental parameters in real-time. The system is designed
                        to collect, process, and transmit weather-related data to a central server, where it can be
                        stored and analyzed. By leveraging IoT technology, the system provides continuous and
                        remote monitoring capabilities, enabling users to access weather updates from anywhere
                        via cloud-based platforms. The collected data can be used for predictive analytics, helping
                        users anticipate weather patterns and make informed decisions.</p>

                    <h2>SafeWalk: Ensuring Women Saftey in Public Spaces</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The safety of women in public spaces remains a critical global
                        issue, significantly affecting
                        their freedom, participation, and overall well-being. Alarming statistics indicate that one in
                        three women worldwide may experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime,
                        underscoring the urgent need for effective intervention. Persistent threats such as verbal and
                        physical harassment, assault, and the constant fear of violence restrict women's mobility and
                        public engagement, depriving them of their sense of security and independence. This initiative
                        introduces a comprehensive, technology-driven approach to enhance women's safety in public areas
                        by integrating advanced solutions, community involvement, and strategic partnerships. The
                        primary objective is to develop an all-in-one system that ensures both psychological and
                        physical security for women navigating public spaces. Key features include a user-friendly
                        mobile app built using React Native for seamless communication, Next.js powers the
                        implementation of real-time safety insights through community-based reporting, incident
                        reporting and SOS emergency alert button for instant assistance. Additionally, the system
                        integrates Firebase for secure user and admin authentication, ensuring a reliable and protected
                        access system. Also, the system includes identification of safety zones for the users. By
                        implementing these essential features, the project empowers women with a renewed sense of
                        confidence and security, enabling them to reclaim public spaces without fear. Beyond being a
                        technological solution, this initiative represents a broader societal commitment to safeguarding
                        women's rights and dignity. Through strategic planning, innovation, and collaboration, the
                        project aims to establish a new benchmark for public safety and diversity.</p>

                    <h2>KSRTC Bus Notification System</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The KSRTC Rural Bus Notification System is a web-based application
                        that sends real-time
                        updates and messages to passengers on bus availability, routes, and delays. The system is
                        made up of two main modules: Admin and User. The Admin module enables authorized
                        workers to control bus routes using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and
                        to send notifications of delays or route cancellations. The User module allows passengers
                        to view bus schedules, check route availability, find nearby stations, and receive email
                        notifications about cancellations and delays. There is also map integration that helps users
                        locate all nearby bus stations within a 5 km range. This system increases the efficiency
                        of public transportation by keeping passengers informed, minimizing uncertainty, and
                        improving their overall trip experience. It is intended to be user-friendly, with seamless
                        access to information for both administrators and passengers. This system acts as a
                        connection between passengers and the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation,
                        promoting a more transparent and dependable public transportation system</p>
